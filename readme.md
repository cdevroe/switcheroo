# Switcheroo - Little Arc for Safari

Switcheroo is a small utility Mac app that can be set as your default browser and becomes an interstitial window that allows you to choose which Safari Profile youâ€™d like a link to be loaded in.

## Instructions

Currently, setting up existing Safari Profiles in Switcheroo is a bit hacky and cumbersome. Here is what you'll need to do. This set of instructions assumes you have at least 2 Safari Profiles.

1. Open a new tab in an existing Profile (well call it Profile A) and navigate to a webpage with a known URL. E.g. https://github.com/cdevroe/switcheroo and move this tab to the left most pinned tab location. This URL will be used by Switcheroo to identify the Profile. It can be any URL of your choice.
1. Open Switcheroo's settings window
1. Type in the name of the Safari Profile A (the name does not need to match what is actually in Safari, the URL is the real identifier currently)
1. Paste the URL you choose for the left most tab of the Safari Profile A
1. Hit the + button
1. Repeat for the Safari Profiles you'd like set up in Switcheroo, be sure to choose a unique URL for each profile.
1. Set Switcheroo as your default browser in Settings > Desktop & Dock > Default web browser
